# EAVS Section B Data Standard
## Project Description
Developed through a collaborative agreement between the Council of State Governments and the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP), the Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS) Section B Data Standard aims to reduce the amount of work required for election officials to complete the EAVS. A data export, based on voter-level transactional data, can be compiled to answer the questions in Section B as well as provide more comprehensive information for analysis.
